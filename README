SystemCASS Installation
=======================

Please use automake/autoconf to install SystemCASS.
SystemCASS is able to generate trace files into VCD and also the ALLIANCE
format : PAT.

PAT trace ouput
===============

PAT trace output is disable by default.
Set the environment variable 'ALLIANCE' to ALLIANCE top directory, 
then make again.

TODO
====
- Fix some bugs, reported on 64 bits machines.
- testbenches: 
  * 15042009: in somes cases, the developper has to use "sc_signal<T>::read()"
              method to explicitly read a sc_signal. OSCI's SystemC does not 
              need to call explicitly this method. LRM gives no information 
              about it.
  * 19042005: trace file contains some useless lines about 64 bits signals.
- simulations using OpenMP capabilities
